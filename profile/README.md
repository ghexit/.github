## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ At GHexit we collect resources on leaving Github to ease the transition away from this website.
🌈 Contribution guidelines - Please let us know anything that has helped you leave the platform!
👩‍💻 Useful resources
  • [leave](github.com/ghexit/leave) is for people offboarding from Github  • [protest](github.com/ghexit/protest) is for people who are stuck using Github, but who share the concerns of those leaving, and want to support the effort to hold Github accountable.
🧙 Remember, Github is doing terrible things to the power of [(Github-Flavored) Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
